## Belt Granted: Purple Belt

It turns out that Austin Richard Post was part of a larger criminal organization. Their exportation of rodents has left the agency at a loss. One of our agents reports having found a documentation server of the organization. This is our only thread to keep this investigation. We have it on rumor, that the passwords can be found in under the root directory, under the filename "/flag.txt". Can you infiltrate the server and find the contents of that file?

NOTE: This exercise must be performed while on "BYUI" Network or while VPN'ed in. If this is not possible, contact Sensei to manually add your IP to allow-list.
