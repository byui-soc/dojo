# Challenge 3

## Belt Granted: Orange Belt
## Skills used: Veracrypt, Hashcat, Digital Forensics

The National Cyber Investigative Joint Task Force needs your help. They've exhausted their Agents' expertise, and need anyone who can figure this out. There are key pieces of expected evidence that are missing from the suspect's computer. The suspect is a well known rapper, Austin Richard Post. Agents have identified a strange file on one of Austin's hard drives. They believe it might be the smoking gun in cracking this investigation.

Can you help us? I've attached the file below.
